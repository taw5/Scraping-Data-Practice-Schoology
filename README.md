# Scraping-Data-Practice-Schoology
Just some practice on data scraping, not too familiar with XHTML and data querying. tutorials work i guess. make sure you edit config.py with google email &amp; pass for the bot to work. usually takes a few hours to get 2k emails (just a start, might try APIs some time later to make it faster), must know what the ID range is of users in said school.
